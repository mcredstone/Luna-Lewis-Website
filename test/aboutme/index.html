		    <h3>My name is Daniel Lewis and I am 8 years old...</h3>
			<p>I started to code when I was 7. I had done Scratch before, but I wanted to go further.<br>I branched into Python, starting basic, and then I made games. I then tried to make my own webpage<br>in HTML. I learned CSS, then Javascript and PHP, so that I woud be able<br>to make this very site. Then I wanted to make apps, so I did Java,<br>difficult but powerful. I made my very first SQL Server and Ruby script.<br>I've done a lot. I met Robert when I was nearly 8, and was delighted when I discovered that he codes as well.<br>He now helps me with several projects, and is coding his own website (www.robertselectronics.com).<br>I live in Histon, Cambridge and love the technology in the city.<br>I want to carry on coding for a long time.
